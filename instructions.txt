2. **Run the Main Script:**
   - Run `main.py` and enter the name of your combolist (e.g., `combo.txt`).
   - The script will process the users from the list.

3. **Data Output:**
   - The results will be saved in `checked.txt`.
   - This file contains account details such as follower counts and email addresses.

4. **Create & Reset Emails:**
   - Use the found emails (Hotmail and Gmail work best) to reset passwords.
   - Accounts may not always match, but you’ll often find accounts with good stats (10k+ followers).

5. **Enjoy!**
